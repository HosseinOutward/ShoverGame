# ShoverGame
construct3 and Django server files for a game called Shover which can be played both solo and as a multiplayer game
introduced in AI course (2021) at SBU by Ali Katanforosh

this repo has the following files:
src files for the construct3 free version (both multiplayer and singleplayer)
a Django based server to handle ajax requests and connections

notes:
the multiplayer version uses ajax to communicate with the server
the server does NOT simulate the game and only makes sure that both sides have the same values for everything
